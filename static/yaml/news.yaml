- title: Minor upgrades to the site
  date: 5/14/2014
  body: |
      <p>Over the past day or two we've made several improvements to the site.</p>
      <ul><li>Pagination on the All blocks and All transactions pages, they were getting too long.</li>
          <li>User Stats now includes payout summaries for all merge mined currencies (MON and PLX).</li>
          <li>User Stats now shows all time blocks solved, shares contributed, and 24 hour efficiency for all workers.</li>
          <li>Network Stats shows network information for MON and PLX as well (no graphs quite yet...).</li>
          <li>Small payout amounts now won't get rounded to 0.0, instead 2 significant figures will be show (tooltips show full unrounded amount)</li>
      </ul>
- title: Connectivity issues and new stratums
  date: 5/11/2014
  body: |
      <p>As some of you noticed, we had some connectivity issues yesterday. One of the routers at our hosts datacenter
      was experiencing packet loss causing some people to intermittently connect or be completely unable to connect. As
      a remedy to this we are working on adding several new stratum servers, located in geographically different areas.
      This should help mitigate connection issues, and decrease stale shares if you use a server closer to your location.</p>
      
      <p>We have added a high difficulty stratum, on port 3345, and are currently working to add 2 geographic servers, 
      one in Singapore to serve Asia and Australia, and another in France to cover Europe.
      We'll be working to get these servers setup this week, but it could take longer.</p>
- title: Merged mining stratum upgrades
  date: 5/8/2014
  body: |
      <p>We've made several changes to the way our stratum servers handle merged mining, they were 
      previously requesting work restarts far too frequently to include updated information from the merge mined
      block chains. Our changes appears to have improved efficiency for most miners by a noticable amount,
      but will result in a small(~2%) increase in orphans on merge mined coins.</p>
      
      <p>We have had to further reduced the MON bonus, its now at 2.5%. Nearly everyone has added
      a MON address! Additionally, with the stratum upgrades behind us we are still on track for an alpha
      release of triple merged mining late Thursday or Friday if everything goes well, but we are thoroughly
      testing everything as we go, and its not unreasonable that we will hit a snag, and won't be done until 
      the weekend.</p>
- title: Simple Vert is adding support for merged mining Parallax(PLX) coin alongside MON and VTC
  date: 5/7/2014
  body: |
      <p>Since we've been getting a ton of questions about it, this is just a heads up that we are going
      to be adding PLX as an additional merge mined coin. This means if you're mining with us you'll be
      basically triple mining (VTC, MON, as well as PLX). We are currently testing the code to run it, 
      and we'll likely have an alpha out for you guys sometime tomorrow or Friday.</p>
      
      <p>This process will go very similar to how it went when we added MON. Basically you'll have to
      add a PLX address to recieve credit for your merged mining, this will be done via a link on 
      your user stats page. For the initial release we may or may not have block/payout stats available for 
      you immediately, our focus is on getting it running first, and then displaying it nicely.</p>
- title: A few recent and upcoming changes
  date: 5/5/2014
  body: |
    <p>We've adjusted Vertcoin payouts to run every 4 hours instead of every block. With our
    recent growth many smaller miners were getting spammed with essentially dust transactions. Overall
    feedback on this has been positive, but feel free to drop in IRC if you have questions/concerns.</p>
    
    <p>We recently rebooted the stratum server (downtime ~10seconds) to fix few things for a few of our spammier
    miners, one of those changes included increasing the fixed difficulty to 64. This won't change
    your payout, but may make your graphs a bit spikier if you are a smaller miner. If it bothers
    you feel free to try out our vardiff port :3344</p>
    
    <p>In the next few days we'll be automating Monocle payouts, they will probably run on the same
    schedule as VTC. We've also started work on adding merged mining for Parallax coin, but we're not
    ready to commit to a date/time just yet.</p>
- title: Merged Mining with Monocle Coin Running Solid
  date: 5/4/2014
  body: |
    <p>We've been closely monitoring the merged mining, and it seems to be
    running smoothly. At this point we're basically just adding more stats,
    and fixing a couple last bugs. There will likely be a couple of quick restarts
    of the stratum server(basically everyone gets disconnected for a second)
    over the next few days to smooth out the remaining bugs.</p>

    <p>Tonight we've reset the stratum to fix a bug causing worker count to be too 
    high. So don't be alarmed if you notice that the worker count has 'dropped' a lot,
    its just being actually accurately represented. We're also changing 
    user stats Rejected 24hr shares to only show shares rejected as stale. 
    We have several users who are submitting quite a few duplicate and low diff shares, 
    and we don't think this is representative of their actual efficiency stats.</p>

    <p>Also, in case you hadn't seen this information elsewhere here's what you
    need to know about our new MON merged mining support</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You don't need to change your miners configs at all, they're already mining MON as well as VTC.</li>
        <li>To recieve the MON that you helped mine you'll need to sign a message with your Vertcoin wallet. Click the edit button right under your Vertcoin address on your stats page to do this.</li>
        <li>MON payouts happen about every 6 hours right now. We're doing them by hand at the moment, but they will be automated soon.</li>
        <li>As of now a <b>10% bonus</b> is being added to all MON payouts!</li>
    </ul>
- title: Simple Vert is adding support for merged mining Monocle(MON) coin
  date: 4/29/2014
  body: |
      After weighing the pros and cons, we've decided to add support for merged mining
      to our pool software. AFAIK, this will make us the only non-p2pool to support
      mergemining Monocle coin at this
      time(<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=585817">read more about MON</a>).
      <br><p>
      Unfortunately this is a non-trivial change to the backend,
      and will require pretty thorough testing before we're comfortable running it in production. Because of that, we aren't
      ready to commit to a specific completion date. A reasonable guess is sometime after the weekend, but it could
      take a lot longer(or a lot shorter) depending on how many problems we hit.
      <br><p>
      Once we're up and running you'll need to add a Monocle address to start recieving payouts.
      We'll have more information on this as we get closer, but it'll be very similar to the process used to change
      your fee amount, and will require signing a message with your wallet client.
- title: New updates to the site
  date: 4/26/2014
  body: |
      Today we're glad to announce the release of v0.6 of our SimpleCoin software.
      This includes the following interface improvements:
      <ul><li>Sorting for all tables on the site. Just click the headers to sort by that column.</li>
          <li>Prioritized recently visited stats. The addresses you visit the most often will naturally be at the top of the list.</li>
          <li>See orphan percentage, effective payout/MH/day, and all time luck on pool stats</li>
          <li>View the networks difficulty/hashrate over time in our new Network Stats. Note that we're still smoothing out the kinks, so some things may be a bit off.</li>
          <li>See all transactions for your address, instead of just the last 20</li>
          <li>Set a donation amount that is isn't a whole number, like 1.5%</li>
      </ul>
      In addition to these frontend improvements there were numerous backend
      improvements that should help keep our site running quickly. There may 
      still be a few lingering bugs here and there that we'll be working to
      fix in the next couple days. Let us know on IRC if you see anything that
      looks off.
- title: Minor vardiff bug causing false rejects
  date: 4/15/2014
  body: |
    We've identified a bug in our vardiff server - which causes a some false rejects to occur.
    It does not impact your actual mining perfomance at all. If this concerns you just switch away 
    from vardiff for now. Basically, occasionally vardiff will tell your
    client to submit shares which match a difficulty lower than vardiff is accepting. This means the server
    then rejects those low diff shares. You are not actually losing any performance, because its still 
    accepting shares at the correct difficulty(statistically its the same), it just gives you 
    rejected messages when it shouldn't. We'll be patching this (and it'll require a reboot w/ a min or 
    two of downtime), probably in the next week.
- title: Vardiff lives!
  date: 4/5/2014
  body: |
      I know a lot of people have been asking and it's finally here! Apologies
      for the delays, but we wanted to make sure we didn't release something
      subpar. You can connect to the vardiff server on port 3344 instead of
      3343.

- title: Stats upgrade pt.2
  date: 4/5/2014
  body: |
    If you're using PPAgent you can now view historical graphs of temperature and actual hashrate.
    We will be tweaking them a bit for the next while. Let us know if there's other stats you'd
    like to see graphed!
- title: Stats upgrade pt.1
  date: 4/1/2014
  body: |
    Worker stats have been improved. Now your workers are sorted (numerically/alphabetically).
    Also, if you're using PPAgent you'll notice it now calculates your WU, Total Hashrate, and
    WUE at the worker level. The WUE has a status indicator to give you an idea of the health
    at a glance. In the next few days(pt 2) we'll be rolling out temperature and hashrate graphs
    for ppagent stats.
- title: ~12 minutes of downtime last night
  date: 3/31/2014
  body: |
    Last night we had a minor issue with our queueing server that caused work to
    be lost for about 12 minutes (~4:17-4:29 GMT) while we patched it live. We've 
    fixed the issue and do not expect it to be a problem in the future.
- title: Simple Vert Launch!
  date: 3/29/2014
  body: |
    Simple Vert is now up and running! With the same base software as Simple Doge
    we're bringing new features to the growing vertcoin community as well.
