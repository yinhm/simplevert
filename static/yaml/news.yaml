- title: Minor vardiff bug causing false rejects
  date: 4/15/2014
  body: |
    We've identified a bug in our vardiff server - which causes a some false rejects to occur.
    It does not impact your actual mining perfomance at all. If this concerns you just switch away 
    from vardiff for now. Basically, occasionally vardiff will tell your
    client to submit shares which match a difficulty lower than vardiff is accepting. This means the server
    then rejects those low diff shares. You are not actually losing any performance, because its still 
    accepting shares at the correct difficulty(statistically its the same), it just gives you 
    rejected messages when it shouldn't. We'll be patching this (and it'll require a reboot w/ a min or 
    two of downtime), probably in the next week.

      I know a lot of people have been asking and it's finally here! Apologies
      for the delays, but we wanted to make sure we didn't release something
      subpar. You can connect to the vardiff server on port 3344 instead of
      3343.

    If you're using PPAgent you can now view historical graphs of temperature and actual hashrate.
    We will be tweaking them a bit for the next while. Let us know if there's other stats you'd
    like to see graphed!

    Worker stats have been improved. Now your workers are sorted (numerically/alphabetically).
    Also, if you're using PPAgent you'll notice it now calculates your WU, Total Hashrate, and
    WUE at the worker level. The WUE has a status indicator to give you an idea of the health
    at a glance. In the next few days(pt 2) we'll be rolling out temperature and hashrate graphs
    for ppagent stats.

    Last night we had a minor issue with our queueing server that caused work to
    be lost for about 12 minutes (~4:17-4:29 GMT) while we patched it live. We've 
    fixed the issue and do not expect it to be a problem in the future.
